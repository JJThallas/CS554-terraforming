# CS554-terraforming

This project is my submission to CS 554 Project 2: Terraform.

It involves using [Terraforming](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform) to create and manage small container clusters through both Docker and k8s, giving two seperate demos of cluster environments.

This README contains a reflection of this project. More documentation about the layout of the individual clusters lies within the project folders.
